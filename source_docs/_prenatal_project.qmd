This project examines narratives of decisions making found in three Reddit forums: r/NIPT, r/BabyBumps, and r/Pregnant. Our study examined 20 threads from each of these subreddits to examine the shape of online conversations supporting pregnant people through two key questions 1) Should I get prenatal genetic tests and 2) When results come back abnormal, what should I do? This work is in conversation with scholarship about counter narratives since we are interested in how these stories differ from more dominant narratives of testing and termination in the U.S.
