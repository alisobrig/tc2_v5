One area of interest for me is how technology interacts with people and how we use technology to navigate the visible and invisible phenomena that shape our world. One rich, albeit more unconventional, space for this is paranormal investigation. I am interested in how communities of paranormal investigators shape methods with technology, relate to technology, and invoke science as part of their understanding of unseen things. There are interesting provocations/challenges this community provides when we think about processes of science and wider understandings of technology (especially AI and scientific laboratory devices). I always feel the need to add a caveat here - I think the question of "are ghosts real" is one of the least interesting. For me, the more important questions include

-   How or why do we believe in ghosts? How does technology factor into that?
-   How or why do we feel the need to prove our beliefs? How do we communicate and interpret our beliefs to others? How or why do some become conspiracy theories?
-   How or why does science show up in this space? Science is invoked here, what do those rhetorics mean about science, people, technology, method?
