The diagram below is a summary of my academic timeline. I arrived at the UMN RSTC program with a background in rhetoric/writing and biology. During my Master's experience I explored how scientists communicate on TikTok which sharpened my interest in how technology is a mediator for communication that fundamentally changes the shape and influence of our words.
